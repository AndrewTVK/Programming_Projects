This program is a disassembler written in assembly for the motorola 68k. It takes in an address where machine code has been stored, and a stop address. The program takes two bytes at a time, starting at the inputed start address, and converts the code found in those two bytes into an assassembly instruction that the program supports. If the data does not match a supported instruction "data" and the two bytes in hex are outputted, otherwise the instruction is outputted with the correct effective addresses. This program was designed and written with a partner for a final project in a hardware and computer organization class.
